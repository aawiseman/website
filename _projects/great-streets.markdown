MappingDC is collaborating with the DC government on a project called [Great Streets](http://greatstreets.dc.gov/).  There are 11 corridors scattered throughout DC which we will cover including:

* Connecticut Avenue NW
* Georgia Ave NW
* H Street NE - Bladensburg Road NE
* Minnesota Ave NE - Benning Road NE
* Martin Luther King Jr Avenue - A/B/C
* Nannie Helen Burroughs Avenue
* New York Avenue
* North Capitol Street
* Pennsylvania Avenue - A/B/C
* Rhode Island Avenue
* U Street - 14th Street

Together we put these business corridors on OpenStreetMap while also observing them for opportunities of capital improvement grants.

Follow MappingDC on Meetup to join us as we cover these areas of DC.
